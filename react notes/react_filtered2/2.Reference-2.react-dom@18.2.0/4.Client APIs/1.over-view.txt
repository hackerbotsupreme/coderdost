API REFERENCE
Client React DOM APIs
The react-dom/client APIs let you render React components on the client (in the browser). These APIs are typically used at the top level of your app to initialize your React tree. A framework may call them for you. Most of your components donâ€™t need to import or use them.

Client APIs 
createRoot lets you create a root to display React components inside a browser DOM node.
hydrateRoot lets you display React components inside a browser DOM node whose HTML content was previously generated by react-dom/server.
Browser support 
React supports all popular browsers, including Internet Explorer 9 and above. Some polyfills are required for older browsers such as IE 9 and IE 10.
