React’s extensions to <form> are currently only available in React’s canary and experimental channels. In stable releases of React <form> works only as a built-in browser HTML component

The built-in browser <form> component lets you create interactive controls for submitting information.

<form action={search}>
    <input name="query" />
    <button type="submit">Search</button>
</form>

Usage 
Handle form submission on the client 
Pass a function to the action prop of form to run the function when the form is submitted

export default function Search() {
  function search(formData) {
    const query = formData.get("query");
    alert(`You searched for '${query}'`);
  }
  return (
    <form action={search}>
      <input name="query" />
      <button type="submit">Search</button>
    </form>
  );
}

Handle form submission with a Server Action
