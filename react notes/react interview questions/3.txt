what is strng immutibility in js with examples ?

In JavaScript, `String` values are **immutable**, which means that they cannot be altered once created. This is a fundamental property of strings in JavaScript. 

Here are some examples to illustrate this:

**Example 1:**
```javascript
var myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J"; // This will not change myStr to "Job"
console.log(myStr); // This will log "Bob"
```
In the above example, attempting to change a character within a string does not alter the string‚Åµ.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
var str1 = 'Hello, there!';
var str2 = str1.slice(0, 5); 
console.log(str1); // logs "Hello, there!"
console.log(str2); // logs "Hello"
```
In this example, calling `slice()` on `str1` to set a new variable `str2` does not change the value of `str1`¬≥.

**Example 3:**
```javascript
var aString = "This is a string";
var bString = aString;
aString = "The string has changed";
console.log(aString); // logs "The string has changed"
console.log(bString); // logs "This is a string"
console.log(aString === bString); // logs false
```
In this example, changing `aString` does not affect `bString`‚Å¥.

While you can assign a new value to a string variable, the original string value remains unchanged. This is the essence of string immutability in JavaScript.

how can yu select , modify , create and remove dom elements ?

In JavaScript, you can select, modify, create, and remove DOM elements using various methods. Here's how:

**1. Selecting DOM Elements:**
You can select DOM elements using methods like `document.querySelector()`, `document.getElementById()`, `document.getElementsByClassName()`, and `document.getElementsByTagName()`. For example:
```javascript
const demoId = document.querySelector('#demo-id'); // Selects an element with the id "demo-id"
const demoClasses = document.querySelectorAll('.demo-class'); // Selects all elements with the class "demo-class"
```

**2. Modifying DOM Elements:**
You can modify the content, attributes, and styles of DOM elements. For example:
```javascript
demoId.textContent = 'Demo ID text updated.'; // Changes the text content of the selected element
demoClasses.forEach(element => {
  element.textContent = 'All demo classes updated.'; // Changes the text content of all elements with the class "demo-class"
});
```

**3. Creating DOM Elements:**
You can create new DOM elements using the `document.createElement()` method, and then append them to the DOM using `Node.appendChild()`. For example:
```javascript
const newElement = document.createElement('div'); // Creates a new div element
newElement.textContent = 'This is a new element.'; // Sets the text content of the new element
document.body.appendChild(newElement); // Appends the new element to the body of the document
```

**4. Removing DOM Elements:**
You can remove DOM elements using the `ChildNode.remove()` method. For example:
```javascript
const element = document.getElementById('demo'); // Selects an element with the id "demo"
element.remove(); // Removes the selected element from the DOM
```
These are just some of the ways you can interact with the DOM in JavaScript¬≤¬π‚Å¥. Remember, always ensure your DOM manipulations enhance the user experience and maintain the accessibility of your web pages. Happy coding! üòä


what are selectors  in js ? wht is the difference beteen getElememntbyId  and hetElementByClassname ?

In JavaScript, **selectors** are used to find (or select) HTML elements based on their name, id, classes, types, attributes, values of attributes, and much more¬π. They are one of the most important parts of the JavaScript library‚Åµ. Some of the most commonly used methods are `getElementsByTagName()`, `getElementsByClassName()`, `getElementById()`, `querySelector()`, `querySelectorAll()`¬≥.

Now, let's discuss the difference between `getElementById` and `getElementsByClassName`:

- `getElementById()`: This method returns the element that has the ID attribute with the specified value‚Å∂. It is the most used HTML DOM method to manipulate, or get info from, an element on your document‚Å∂. This method returns a single DOM element whose ID matches your query‚Å∏‚Åπ.

- `getElementsByClassName()`: This method returns an object containing all elements with the specified class name, as a collection of HTML Collection object representing a collection of the nodes‚Å∂. The elements returned can be accessed using its index starting from zero‚Å∂. This method returns an HtmlCollection ‚Äì an array-like structure containing the DOM elements that matched your query‚Å∏‚Åπ. You have to iterate through each element in the array to apply your style‚Å∏‚Åπ.

In summary, `getElementById()` returns a single element, while `getElementsByClassName()` returns a collection of elements. Therefore, when using `getElementsByClassName()`, you often need to loop through the returned collection to manipulate each element individually‚Å∑.


what is the difference between querySelector and querySelectorAll ?

The `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()` are both methods in JavaScript used to select DOM elements. However, they have a key difference¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥:

- `querySelector()`: This method returns the **first** element within the document that matches a specified CSS selector(s)¬π. If multiple elements match the selector, it returns only the first matching element¬π. For example:
```javascript
document.querySelector(".test-btn").style.color = "#006600";
```
In this example, only the first element with the class "test-btn" will have its color changed¬π.

- `querySelectorAll()`: This method returns **all** the elements within the document that match the specified CSS selector(s)¬π. It returns all the elements that match the selector in the form of a static NodeList object, which is a collection of nodes¬π. To access each element, you usually use a loop¬π. For example:
```javascript
var x = document.querySelectorAll(".test-btn");
for (var i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
  x[i].style.color = "#006600";
}
```
In this example, all elements with the class "test-btn" will have their color changed¬π.

So, the main difference is that `querySelector()` returns the first matching element, while `querySelectorAll()` returns all matching elements¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥.


what are the methods to modify elements properties and attributes in dom ?

In JavaScript, you can modify the properties and attributes of DOM elements using various methods¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ:

**1. Modifying Attributes:**
You can use the `setAttribute()` method to set a new value to an attribute¬≤. If the attribute does not exist, it is created first¬≤. For example:
```javascript
element.setAttribute("class", "democlass"); // Adds a class attribute to an element
```
You can also use the `getAttribute()` method to get the value of an attribute, and the `removeAttribute()` method to remove an attribute‚Å¥.

**2. Modifying Properties:**
You can directly modify the properties of an element. For example, to change the `src` of an `<img>` element:
```javascript
imgEl.src = "http://www.dogs.com/dog.gif"; // Changes the src of an img element
```
This is equivalent to using the `setAttribute()` method‚Åµ.

**3. Modifying Classes:**
The `classList` property along with its `add()`, `remove()`, `replace()`, and `toggle()` helper methods can be used to conveniently manipulate an element's classes¬≥. For example:
```javascript
element.classList.add("new-class"); // Adds a new class to the element
element.classList.remove("old-class"); // Removes an old class from the element
```

**4. Modifying Styles:**
You can modify the styles of an element using the `style` property. For example:
```javascript
element.style.backgroundColor = "red"; // Changes the background color of the element
```
This is a more recommended way to modify styles than using `setAttribute()` to change the `style` attribute¬≤.

These are some of the ways you can modify the properties and attributes of DOM elements in JavaScript¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ.

difference between innerHTML and textContent ? how to add and remove style from html elements in gom using js ?

The `innerHTML` and `textContent` are both properties in JavaScript used to get or set the content of HTML elements¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ. However, they handle the content differently:

- `innerHTML`: This property gets or sets the HTML content (including HTML markup) of an element¬π¬≤‚Å¥. For example, if an element includes other HTML tags within it, `innerHTML` will include those tags in its output¬π¬≤‚Å¥.

- `textContent`: This property gets or sets the text content of a node and its descendants¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ. It returns only the text content of the elements, excluding all HTML tags¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ. 

In terms of adding and removing styles from HTML elements in the DOM using JavaScript, you can use the following methods:

**Adding Styles:**
You can add styles to an HTML element using the `style` property‚Å∏. For example:
```javascript
var element = document.getElementById('sample_id');
element.style.color = 'blue'; // Changes the color of the text to blue
```

**Removing Styles:**
You can remove styles from an HTML element in a couple of ways‚Å∂‚Å∑[^10^]:

- Setting the style property to an empty string:
```javascript
element.style.color = ''; // Removes the color style from the element
```

- Using the `removeProperty()` method:
```javascript
element.style.removeProperty('color'); // Removes the color style from the element
```

- Using the `removeAttribute()` method to remove all inline styles:
```javascript
element.removeAttribute('style'); // Removes all inline styles from the element
```
Remember, manipulating styles directly on elements should be done sparingly, and as much as possible, styles should be defined in CSS and manipulated by adding or removing classes‚Åπ.


how to create new elements using dom ? difference between createElement and cloneNode ?

In JavaScript, you can create new DOM elements using the `document.createElement()` method‚Åµ‚Å∂‚Å∑‚Å∏‚Åπ. This method takes a string as an argument, which is the name of the element you want to create‚Åµ‚Å∂‚Å∑‚Å∏‚Åπ. Here's an example:

```javascript
const element = document.createElement("div"); // Creates a new div element
element.textContent = "This is a new element."; // Sets the text content of the new element
document.body.appendChild(element); // Appends the new element to the body of the document
```

Now, let's discuss the difference between `createElement` and `cloneNode`:

- `createElement()`: This method creates a new element with the specified tag name‚Åµ‚Å∂‚Å∑‚Å∏‚Åπ. You can then add attributes, properties, and event handlers to the new element‚Åµ‚Å∂‚Å∑‚Å∏‚Åπ.

- `cloneNode()`: This method creates a copy of the node on which it was called‚Å¥. The method takes a boolean parameter: if `true`, the clone is deep and includes all descendants of the node; if `false` or omitted, the clone is shallow and does not include the node's descendants‚Å¥. However, it does not copy event listeners added using `addEventListener()` or those assigned to element properties (e.g., `node.onclick = someFunction`)‚Å¥.

In terms of performance, `cloneNode()` is generally faster than `createElement()`, especially when you need to create multiple similar elements¬π. However, if you need to create a unique element or if the element structure is not already present in the DOM, you would need to use `createElement()`¬π.

diff between createElement and createTextNode ?

In JavaScript, `createElement()` and `createTextNode()` are both used to create new nodes in the Document Object Model (DOM), but they serve different purposes¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ:

- `createElement()`: This method creates a new element node with the specified tag name¬≥. For example, `document.createElement('div')` creates a new `<div>` element¬≥.

- `createTextNode()`: This method creates a new text node¬π¬≤‚Å¥‚Åµ. This is useful when you want to create a node that contains only text¬π¬≤‚Å¥‚Åµ. For example, `document.createTextNode('Hello, world!')` creates a new text node with the text "Hello, world!"¬π¬≤‚Å¥‚Åµ.

Here's an example of how you might use both to add a new paragraph to the body of a document:

```javascript
var para = document.createElement("p"); // Creates a new <p> element
var node = document.createTextNode("This is a new paragraph."); // Creates a new text node
para.appendChild(node); // Appends the text node to the <p> element
document.body.appendChild(para); // Appends the <p> element to the body of the document
```

In this example, `createElement()` is used to create the `<p>` element, and `createTextNode()` is used to create the text that goes inside the `<p>` element¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ.


what is error handling in js ? what is the role of finally block in js ?

In JavaScript, **error handling** is a mechanism to catch and handle runtime errors‚Åµ‚Å∂‚Å∑. Errors can occur due to coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, and other unforeseeable things‚Åµ. When an error occurs, JavaScript will normally stop and generate an error message‚Åµ.

JavaScript provides the `try...catch...finally` block to handle these errors‚Åµ‚Å∂‚Å∑:

- The `try` block contains the code to be executed‚Åµ‚Å∂‚Å∑.
- The `catch` block contains the code to be executed if an error occurs in the `try` block‚Åµ‚Å∂‚Å∑.
- The `finally` block contains the code to be executed regardless of the result‚Åµ‚Å∂‚Å∑.

The `finally` block in JavaScript is used together with `try` and `catch` statements to provide a block of code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥. The code in the `finally` block is guaranteed to run after the code in the `try` block and any associated `catch` block(s)¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥. This is particularly useful for cleanup tasks that should be executed whether the operation succeeded or not¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥. For example, if you open a file in the `try` block, you might want to close it in the `finally` block, even if an error occurred‚Å¥..


what is the purpose of the throw statement in js ?

In JavaScript, the `throw` statement is used to create a user-defined exception¬π¬≤‚Å¥. It allows you to generate an error that can then be caught and handled¬π¬≤‚Å¥. The `throw` statement can be followed by any kind of expression, such as a string, number, boolean, or an object¬π¬≤.

Here's an example:
```javascript
throw "Too big";  // throw a text
throw 500;  // throw a number
```

When a `throw` statement is executed, the current function execution stops, and control is passed to the first `catch` block in the call stack¬≤. If no `catch` block exists among caller functions, the program will terminate¬≤.

Using `throw` with `try` and `catch` lets you control program flow and generate custom error messages¬π. It's a powerful tool for handling errors and exceptions in your JavaScript code¬π¬≤‚Å¥.


what is error propagation in js ?


In JavaScript, **error propagation** is a mechanism that defines how errors propagate or travel through the code to be handled¬π¬≥. It's about how an error is returned and determines whether the application can continue functioning or it's better to stop¬π.

There are two ways to propagate an error in JavaScript:

1. **Throw an exception**: This method terminates the process if not handled. It should be used when the intention is to stop an application when something goes wrong¬π.

2. **Return an error**: This method denotes an expected error case scenario and does not require an application termination¬π.

The method with which an error is returned also defines how the error should be handled¬π. The danger of using the `throw` mechanism to return an error is that it can terminate an application if not handled properly¬π. Just returning errors will not stop an application, but ignoring such errors can bring an application into an unexpected and disordered state¬π.

Another essential aspect when choosing an error propagation mechanism is documentation¬π. When working with TypeScript, the language service infers types of input and output parameters of the functions¬π. If a function returns a parameter of error type, it is visible in the code editor and reduces the risk of missing error handling¬π. The situation differs when a function throws an exception ‚Äî the language service cannot identify it¬π.


what are the  best practices for error handling ?

Here are some best practices for error handling in JavaScript:

1. **Anticipate and Handle Errors**: Always anticipate and handle errors where necessary¬≥. Don't just write code that works, write code that handles when things don't work¬≥.

2. **Use Validation**: Use validation to prevent errors that occur due to incorrect user input¬≥.

3. **Use Tools for Error Tracking and Reporting**: Use tools for error tracking and reporting to help you catch and fix errors quickly¬≥.

4. **Throw Your Own Errors**: Identify where errors might occur and throw your own errors¬π. This allows you to control the error message and makes debugging easier¬π.

5. **Distinguish Between Fatal and Non-Fatal Errors**: Not all errors require the same level of attention¬π. Distinguishing between fatal and non-fatal errors can help you decide the appropriate response¬π.

6. **Provide a Debug Mode**: Providing a debug mode can make it easier to trace and fix errors during development¬π.

7. **Don't Overuse Try/Catch Blocks**: Use `try/catch` blocks mostly on cases where you know an error could occur, such as dealing with external APIs¬π. Overusing `try/catch` can make code harder to understand and debug¬π.

8. **Always Use Error Handling**: Don't let your application fail silently¬π. Always use some form of error handling to catch and handle errors¬π.

Remember, the goal of error handling is not just to prevent errors, but also to provide a good user experience and make debugging easier¬π¬≥.


what are the different types of error in js ?

In JavaScript, there are several types of errors that may occur during script execution¬π¬≤¬≥:

1. **Syntax Error**: This error occurs when you use a predefined syntax incorrectly¬π. For example, missing an opening bracket in the code¬π.

2. **Reference Error**: This error occurs when a variable reference can't be found or hasn't been declared¬π.

3. **Type Error**: This error occurs when a value is used outside the scope of its data type¬π. For example, trying to use a method that doesn't exist for a particular data type¬π.

4. **Evaluation Error**: Current JavaScript engines and EcmaScript specifications do not throw this error. However, it is still available for backward compatibility¬π.

5. **Range Error**: This error occurs when a range of expected values is required¬π. For example, trying to create an array with a negative length¬π.

6. **URI Error**: This error occurs when the wrong characters are used in a URI function¬π.

7. **Internal Error**: This error occurs most often in the JS engine when there is too much data and the stack exceeds its critical size¬π. For example, when there are too many recursion patterns, switch cases, etc., the JS engine gets overwhelmed¬π.

These errors can be a helpful debugging aid, but the reported problem isn't always immediately clear¬≤. Each error is an object based upon the Error object, and has a name and a message¬≤. Errors displayed in the Web console may include a link to the corresponding page below to help you quickly comprehend the problem in your code¬≤..

what are  objects in js ?

In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type¬≥. It's a data type that is composed of a collection of names or keys and values, represented in name:value pairs‚Åµ. The name:value pairs can consist of properties that may contain any data type ‚Äî including strings, numbers, and Booleans ‚Äî as well as methods, which are functions contained within an object‚Åµ.

Here's an example of a JavaScript object:

```javascript
let school = {
  name: 'Vivekananda School',
  location : 'Delhi',
  established : '1971',
  displayInfo : function() {
    console.log(`The school ${this.name} was established in ${this.established} at ${this.location}`);
  }
}
```

In this example, `name`, `location`, and `established` are properties of the `school` object, and `displayInfo` is a method¬≤.

Objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, in the form of ‚Äúkey: value‚Äù pairs¬≤. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object¬≤.

An object can be created with figure brackets `{...}` with an optional list of properties¬≤. A property is a ‚Äúkey: value‚Äù pair, where a key is a string (also called a ‚Äúproperty name‚Äù), and the value can be anything¬≤.

Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types¬≤. An object is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value¬≤. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored¬≤. The variables don‚Äôt actually store the value¬≤.

in how many ways we can  create an object ?

In JavaScript, you can create objects in several ways¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥:

1. **Using Object Literals**: This is the simplest way to create a JavaScript object. You define the property and values inside curly braces¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥. For example:
```javascript
let car = {
  name: 'GT',
  maker: 'BMW',
  engine: '1998cc'
};
```

2. **Using the `new` Keyword**: You can create an object using the `new` keyword with the `Object()` constructor¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥. For example:
```javascript
let car = new Object();
car.name = 'GT';
car.maker = 'BMW';
car.engine = '1998cc';
```

3. **Using a Constructor Function**: You can define a constructor function and then create objects of the constructed type¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥. For example:
```javascript
function Car(name, maker, engine) {
  this.name = name;
  this.maker = maker;
  this.engine = engine;
}
let car = new Car('GT', 'BMW', '1998cc');
```

4. **Using `Object.create()` Method**: The `Object.create()` method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥. For example:
```javascript
let car = Object.create(Object.prototype, {
  name: { value: 'GT', writable: true },
  maker: { value: 'BMW', writable: true },
  engine: { value: '1998cc', writable: true }
});
```

These are the most common ways to create objects in JavaScript¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥.


what is the difference between an array and  an object ?

In JavaScript, both arrays and objects are used to store data, but they do so in different ways¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ:

- **Arrays** are ordered, indexed collections of values¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ. They are best used when the elements are numbers¬π. Arrays store data in an ordered collection, and the data can be accessed using a numerical index¬≤. They are also mutable, and data can be modified at any index¬≤. Arrays are iterable and you can loop through each key and access its value¬≤.

- **Objects** represent ‚Äúthings‚Äù with characteristics (aka properties), while arrays create and store lists of data in a single variable¬≥‚Å¥. Objects are collections of key-value pairs¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ. They are best used when the elements are strings (text)¬π. The keys are iterable and can be accessed in any order¬≤. The data inside objects are known as Properties which consists of a key and a value¬π. The properties can be manipulated using both dot notation and square brackets¬π.

In summary, if you need a list of items where order matters, use an array. If you need to store data about something specific, where each piece of data is labeled, use an object¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ.


how do you  add and modify and delete properties  in an object ?

In JavaScript, you can add, modify, and delete properties in an object¬π¬≤¬≥:

**Adding Properties:**
You can add properties to an object by simply giving it a value¬π. For example:
```javascript
let car = {
  name: 'GT',
  maker: 'BMW'
};
car.engine = '1998cc'; // Adds a new property 'engine' to the car object
```
You can also use bracket notation to add properties¬π:
```javascript
car['color'] = 'Red'; // Adds a new property 'color' to the car object
```

**Modifying Properties:**
You can modify the properties of an object just by reassigning the value to the same key¬≤. For example:
```javascript
car.engine = '2998cc'; // Modifies the 'engine' property of the car object
```

**Deleting Properties:**
You can delete properties from an object using the `delete` keyword¬≥. For example:
```javascript
delete car.color; // Deletes the 'color' property from the car object
```
These are the basic ways to add, modify, and delete properties in a JavaScript object¬π¬≤¬≥..

explain difference between dot notatioin and bracket notation ?

In JavaScript, both dot notation and bracket notation are used to access properties of an object¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ. However, they have different use cases and limitations¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ:

**Dot Notation**:
- Dot notation is simpler and easier to read¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ.
- It involves using a dot or period (.) and a key to access a property¬π.
- It can only be used with property names that are valid variable names¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ.
- It cannot be used for accessing properties dynamically or properties with special characters¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ.

**Bracket Notation**:
- Bracket notation is more flexible and supports dynamic property access¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ.
- It involves using square brackets, in which you have an expression that evaluates to a value¬π.
- That value serves as a key for accessing the property¬π.
- It can be used for accessing properties dynamically and properties with special characters¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ.

In summary, dot notation is faster and easier to read, but it cannot be used for accessing properties dynamically or properties with special characters¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ. Bracket notation can be used for accessing properties dynamically and properties with special characters, but it is slightly slower and can be more verbose¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ.

what are some common methods to interact over the properties of an object ?

In JavaScript, there are several common methods to interact with the properties of an object¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥:

1. **Accessing Properties**: You can access the properties of an object using dot notation or bracket notation¬π. For example:
```javascript
let car = {
  name: 'GT',
  maker: 'BMW',
  engine: '1998cc'
};
console.log(car.name); // Outputs: GT
console.log(car['maker']); // Outputs: BMW
```

2. **Adding Properties**: You can add new properties to an object by simply giving it a value¬π. For example:
```javascript
car.color = 'Red'; // Adds a new property 'color' to the car object
```

3. **Modifying Properties**: You can modify the properties of an object just by reassigning the value to the same key¬π. For example:
```javascript
car.engine = '2998cc'; // Modifies the 'engine' property of the car object
```

4. **Deleting Properties**: You can delete properties from an object using the `delete` keyword¬π. For example:
```javascript
delete car.color; // Deletes the 'color' property from the car object
```

5. **Iterating Over Properties**: You can iterate over the properties of an object using a `for...in` loop¬π. For example:
```javascript
for (let key in car) {
  console.log(`${key} = ${car[key]}`);
}
```

6. **Using `Object.keys()`**: The `Object.keys()` method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names¬≤. For example:
```javascript
console.log(Object.keys(car)); // Outputs: ['name', 'maker', 'engine']
```

7. **Using `Object.values()`**: The `Object.values()` method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values¬≤. For example:
```javascript
console.log(Object.values(car)); // Outputs: ['GT', 'BMW', '1998cc']
```

8. **Using `Object.entries()`**: The `Object.entries()` method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs¬≤. For example:
```javascript
console.log(Object.entries(car)); // Outputs: [['name', 'GT'], ['maker', 'BMW'], ['engine', '1998cc']]
```

These are some of the most common ways to interact with the properties of an object in JavaScript¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥.

how do you check if a property exists in  an object ?

In JavaScript, there are several ways to check if a property exists in an object¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥:

1. **`hasOwnProperty()` Method**: This method returns a boolean value indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property¬π. For example:
```javascript
const food = {
  pizza: 'üçï',
  burger: 'üçî',
  fries: 'üçü',
  cake: 'üéÇ'
};
const exists = food.hasOwnProperty('fries');
console.log(exists); // true
```

2. **`in` Operator**: The `in` operator returns `true` if the property exists in an object¬π. Otherwise, it returns `false`¬π. For example:
```javascript
'cake' in food; // true
'drink' in food; // false
```
Unlike the `hasOwnProperty()` method, the `in` operator looks for the existence of a property within the own properties and also in the inherited properties of an object¬π.

3. **Comparison with `undefined`**: If you try to access a non-existing property from an object, the returned value is `undefined`¬π. By using this logic, you can compare the property with `undefined` to check if the property exists in an object¬π. However, if the object contains a property that has `undefined` value, comparing it with `undefined` will incorrectly evaluate to `false`¬π.

Please note that the `hasOwnProperty()` method only checks the presence of the specified property in the object's own properties¬π. The own properties are those defined directly on the object¬π. If the property is a part of the object's prototype, it is not considered as an object's own property¬π.


how do you clone or copy an object ?

In JavaScript, there are several ways to clone or copy an object¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥:

1. **Using the Spread Operator**: The spread operator (`...`) can be used to create a shallow copy of an object¬π¬≤. For example:
```javascript
let clone = { ...originalObject };
```

2. **Using `Object.assign()`**: The `Object.assign()` method can also be used to create a shallow copy of an object¬π¬≤. For example:
```javascript
let clone = Object.assign({}, originalObject);
```

3. **Using `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`**: These methods can be used to create a deep copy of an object¬π¬≤. However, this method has limitations, such as not being able to properly copy objects that contain functions or new ES6 classes¬π¬≤. For example:
```javascript
let clone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObject));
```

4. **Using `Object.create()`**: The `Object.create()` method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object¬π. This method performs a shallow copy¬π.

Please note that the first three methods perform a shallow copy of the object, meaning that nested objects or arrays will be copied by reference, not duplicated¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥. If you need a deep copy (a separate copy of the original object and all nested objects), you can use the `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` method, with the mentioned limitations¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥.

what is swallow copy ? what is deep copy ? and what is the difference between  both ?

In JavaScript, a **shallow copy** means that only the first level of the object is copied¬π. Deeper levels are referenced¬π. When a new reference variable is assigned the value of the old reference variable, the address stored in the old reference variable is copied into the new one¬π. This means both the old and new reference variable point to the same object in memory¬π. As a result, if the state of the object changes through any of the reference variables it is reflected for both¬π.

On the other hand, a **deep copy** means that all of the values of the new variable are copied and disconnected from the original variable¬π. Deep copy makes a copy of all the members of the old object, allocates a separate memory location for the new object, and then assigns the copied members to the new object¬π. In this way, both the objects are independent of each other and in case of any modification to either one, the other is not affected¬π.

The main difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy is that a shallow copy only copies the first level properties of an object, while a deep copy copies all levels¬π. A shallow copy is useful when dealing with large objects that need to be referenced multiple times, while a deep copy is useful when creating new, independent objects that are not dependent on the original object‚Å¥.

what is set objects in js ?

In JavaScript, a `Set` is a built-in object that allows you to store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references¬π¬≤¬≥. Here are some key characteristics of a `Set`:

- A `Set` object lets you store unique values¬π¬≤¬≥.
- A value in the `Set` may only occur once; it is unique in the `Set`'s collection¬π¬≤¬≥.
- You can iterate through the elements of a `Set` in insertion order¬π¬≤¬≥.
- The `Set` object provides some methods that allow you to compose sets like you would with mathematical operations¬π.
- All `Set` methods require this to be an actual `Set` instance, but their arguments just need to be set-like¬π.

Here are some common methods associated with a `Set`¬≤:

- `new Set()`: Creates a new `Set`.
- `add()`: Adds a new element to the `Set`.
- `delete()`: Removes an element from a `Set`.
- `has()`: Returns `true` if a value exists.
- `clear()`: Removes all elements from a `Set`.
- `forEach()`: Invokes a callback for each element.
- `values()`: Returns an Iterator with all the values in a `Set`.
- `keys()`: Same as `values()`.
- `entries()`: Returns an Iterator with the [value,value] pairs from a `Set`.

You can create a JavaScript `Set` by passing an Array to `new Set()`, or create a new `Set` and use `add()` to add values¬≤.

map object in js ?

In JavaScript, a `Map` is a built-in object that allows you to store unique key-value pairs¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥. Here are some key characteristics of a `Map`:

- A `Map` object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥.
- Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥.
- A key in the `Map` may only occur once; it is unique in the `Map`'s collection¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥.
- A `Map` object is iterated by key-value pairs ‚Äî a `for...of` loop returns a 2-member array of `[key, value]` for each iteration¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥.

Here are some common methods associated with a `Map`¬≤:

- `new Map()`: Creates a new `Map`.
- `set()`: Sets the value for a key in a `Map`.
- `get()`: Gets the value for a key in a `Map`.
- `clear()`: Removes all the elements from a `Map`.
- `delete()`: Removes a `Map` element specified by a key.
- `has()`: Returns `true` if a key exists in a `Map`.
- `forEach()`: Invokes a callback for each key/value pair in a `Map`.
- `entries()`: Returns an iterator object with the `[key, value]` pairs in a `Map`.
- `keys()`: Returns an iterator object with the keys in a `Map`.
- `values()`: Returns an iterator object of the values in a `Map`.

You can create a JavaScript `Map` by passing an Array to `new Map()`, or create a new `Map` and use `Map.set()` to add values¬≤.

what is the diff between map and object in js ?

In JavaScript, both `Map` and `Object` are used to store data in the form of key-value pairs¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ. However, there are some differences between them¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ:

- **Key Types**: In an `Object`, the data-type of the key-field is restricted to integer, strings, and symbols¬π. Whereas in a `Map`, the key-field can be of any data-type (integer, an array, even an object!)¬π.

- **Order of Elements**: In a `Map`, the original order of elements is preserved¬π‚Å¥. This is not true in case of objects¬π‚Å¥.

- **Size Property**: You can get the size of a `Map` easily with the `size` property¬π. In an `Object`, the size needs to be calculated manually with the help of `Object.keys()`¬π.

- **Iteration**: A `Map` object can iterate its elements in insertion order¬≤. A `for...of` loop will return an array of `[key, value]` for each iteration¬≤. On the other hand, the properties of an `Object` do not have a specific order¬≤.

- **Performance**: `Map` performs better in scenarios involving frequent additions and removals of key-value pairs¬≤.

In summary, while both `Map` and `Object` can be used to store key-value pairs, the choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of your situation¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ.

what are events ?  how are events are triggered ?

In JavaScript, **events** are things that happen to HTML elements¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥. They can be something the browser does, or something a user does¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥. Examples of HTML events include an HTML web page finishing loading, an HTML input field being changed, or an HTML button being clicked¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥.

Events are fired inside the browser window, and tend to be attached to a specific item that resides in it¬≥. This might be a single element, a set of elements, the HTML document loaded in the current tab, or the entire browser window¬≥.

When an event occurs, you may want to do something¬π. JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected¬π. HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements¬π.

Events are triggered in the following way‚Å∂‚Å∑:

1. The event is triggered by the user or the browser‚Å∂‚Å∑.
2. The event is caught by the browser‚Å∂‚Å∑.
3. The event is passed to the event listener‚Å∂‚Å∑.
4. The event listener is called which calls the function that is passed to it‚Å∂‚Å∑.

For example, when a user clicks a button on a webpage, an `onclick` event is triggered¬π. The browser detects this event and passes it to the event listener‚Å∂‚Å∑. The event listener then calls the function that has been defined to handle this event‚Å∂‚Å∑. This could be a function that changes the content of the webpage, opens a new webpage, or any other action defined in the function¬π‚Å∂‚Å∑.


what are types of events in js ?

In JavaScript, there are several types of events that can occur. Here are some of the most common ones¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥:

1. **Window Events**: These are triggered by the window object. For example, the `load` event is triggered when the browser has finished loading the page¬π.

2. **Mouse Events**: These are triggered by user interactions with the mouse. Examples include `click`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`, `mousedown`, and `mouseup`¬π¬≤.

3. **Keyboard Events**: These are triggered by user interactions with the keyboard. Examples include `keydown` and `keyup`¬≤.

4. **Form Events**: These are triggered by interactions with form elements. Examples include `submit`, `focus`, `blur`, and `change`¬≤.

5. **Media Events**: These are triggered by interactions with HTML media elements like `<audio>` and `<video>`. Examples include `play`, `pause`, and `ended`¬≥.

6. **Storage Events**: These are triggered when a storage area in the browser has been changed¬≥.

Remember, when these events occur, you can use JavaScript to execute code in response¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥.

what is event objects in js ?

In JavaScript, an **Event Object** represents an event which takes place in the DOM‚Å¥. An event can be triggered by the user action e.g. clicking the mouse button or tapping keyboard, or generated by APIs to represent the progress of an asynchronous task‚Å¥.

When an event occurs in HTML, the event belongs to a certain event object, like a mouse click event belongs to the MouseEvent object‚Åµ. All event objects in the HTML DOM are based on the Event Object¬π‚Åµ. All event objects (like MouseEvent and KeyboardEvent) have access to the Event Object's properties and methods¬π‚Åµ.

The Event Object's properties and methods include¬π:

- `bubbles`: Returns whether or not a specific event is a bubbling event.
- `cancelBubble`: Sets or returns whether the event should propagate up the hierarchy or not.
- `cancelable`: Returns whether or not an event can have its default action prevented.
- `composed`: Returns whether the event is composed or not.
- `createEvent()`: Creates a new event.
- `composedPath()`: Returns the event's path.
- `currentTarget`: Returns the element whose event listeners triggered the event.
- `defaultPrevented`: Returns whether or not the `preventDefault()` method was called for the event.
- `eventPhase`: Returns which phase of the event flow is currently being evaluated.

These properties and methods provide information about the event, such as the element that triggered the event, the type of the event, and more¬π‚Åµ. They can be used to control the behavior of the event, such as preventing the default action of the event¬π‚Åµ.

what is event delegation  in js ?

Event delegation in JavaScript is a pattern that efficiently handles events¬≥. It allows you to handle events at a higher level in the DOM tree other than the level where the event was first received¬≤¬≥‚Å¥. 

The idea is that if we have a lot of elements handled in a similar way, then instead of assigning a handler to each of them, we put a single handler on their common ancestor¬π. In the handler, we get `event.target` to see where the event actually happened and handle it¬π.

Here's an example of event delegation:

```javascript
const div = document.getElementsByTagName("div")[0]
div.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  if(event.target.tagName === 'BUTTON') {
    console.log("button was clicked")
  }
})
```

In this code, when you click the button, the event bubbles up to the `div` which handles the event¬≤. This pattern allows you to write cleaner code, and create fewer event listeners with similar logic¬≤. It is based upon the concept of Event Bubbling¬≤.

what is event bubbling in js ?

Event bubbling is a concept in the Document Object Model (DOM) of JavaScript¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ. It happens when an event is triggered on an element, and that event bubbles up (or is transmitted or propagated) to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ.

When an event occurs on an element, it first triggers the event on the target element and then bubbles up to its parent and ancestor elements¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ. This means that the event handlers on the parent and ancestor elements will also be triggered¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ.

For example, if you have a button inside a div, and both the button and the div have a click event handler, clicking the button will trigger both the button's click event and the div's click event because of event bubbling¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ.

This behavior makes it possible for you to handle an event in a parent element instead of the actual element that received the event¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ. The pattern of handling an event on an ancestor element is called Event Delegation¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ.

However, any handler may decide that the event has been fully processed and stop the bubbling‚Åµ. The method for it is `event.stopPropagation()`‚Åµ.


how can you stop event propagation or event bubbling in js ?

In JavaScript, you can stop event propagation (also known as event bubbling) by using the `stopPropagation()` method of the event object. This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event.

Here's a simple example:

```javascript
element.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    event.stopPropagation();
    // Your code here...
}, false);
```

In this code, when the element is clicked, the `stopPropagation()` method is called on the event object, which stops the event from bubbling up to any parent elements.

It's important to note that `stopPropagation()` does not prevent any default behaviors from occurring. If you also want to prevent the default behavior, you can use the `preventDefault()` method:

```javascript
element.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    event.stopPropagation();
    // Your code here...
}, false);
```

In this code, `preventDefault()` is called before `stopPropagation()`. This stops the default action associated with the event (for example, following a link) as well as stopping the event from bubbling up. 

Remember, these methods should be used judiciously as they can interfere with the normal flow of events in your web application. It's generally best to use them only when necessary.


what is event capturing in js ?

Event capturing is the phase in the event flow when the event descends the DOM hierarchy to the target element. It's the opposite of event bubbling, which is when the event bubbles up from the target element through its ancestors.

Here's how it works:

1. When an event occurs, the browser checks the outermost element for event handlers registered for the event in the capturing phase. This is done by setting the `useCapture` parameter to `true` when registering an event handler using `addEventListener()`.

```javascript
element.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    // Your code here...
}, true); // Setting useCapture to true
```

2. If an event handler is found, it runs. Then the browser moves down the DOM hierarchy to the next element and checks for any event handlers registered for the event in the capturing phase.

3. This process continues down the DOM hierarchy until the target element is reached. At this point, the event is said to be at the target phase.

4. After the target phase, if the event is set to bubble (which is the default for most events), the event bubbles up the DOM hierarchy (the bubbling phase), triggering any event handlers registered for the bubbling phase (i.e., `useCapture` is `false` or not provided).

So, event capturing is the process of an event starting from the outermost element and ending at the target. It's part of the event flow in the DOM, which consists of the capturing phase, the target phase, and the bubbling phase. 

Remember, not all events bubble, but all events go through the capturing and target phases. Also, the use of capturing is rare, as bubbling is more commonly used. But it's there if you need it!


what is the purpose of the event ?

In the context of JavaScript and web development, an event is a signal that something has happened. This "something" can be a variety of things - a user clicking a button, a page finishing loading, a form being submitted, a timer going off, etc.

The purpose of these events is to provide a way for your code to react to these occurrences. You can write code (known as an event handler or event listener) that runs in response to a specific event. This allows you to create dynamic, interactive web applications. For example, you could write an event handler that runs when a button is clicked and changes the color of the button.

Here's a simple example:

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    button.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
});
```

In this code, an event listener is added to a button that listens for the 'click' event. When the button is clicked, the event listener runs and changes the background color of the button to red.

So, the purpose of an event is to signal that something has happened so that your code can react in some way. It's a fundamental part of how interactivity works on the web.


preventDefault () method in js ?

The `preventDefault()` method in JavaScript is used to prevent the default action of an event from being performed. 

When an event occurs, the browser will normally perform some default action. For example, if a link is clicked, the browser will normally navigate to the link's URL. If a form is submitted, the browser will normally send the form's data to the server.

However, there are times when you might want to prevent this default action from occurring. This is where the `preventDefault()` method comes in.

Here's an example:

```javascript
link.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    // Your code here...
});
```

In this code, an event listener is added to a link that listens for the 'click' event. When the link is clicked, the `preventDefault()` method is called on the event object, which prevents the browser from navigating to the link's URL.

It's important to note that `preventDefault()` does not stop the event from bubbling up the DOM tree. If you also want to stop the event propagation, you can use the `stopPropagation()` method. 

Remember, these methods should be used judiciously as they can interfere with the normal flow of events in your web application. It's generally best to use them only when necessary.



what is the use of this keyword in the context of event handling in js ?

In JavaScript, the `this` keyword in the context of event handling refers to the object that the event was dispatched on. It gives you a way to access the properties and methods of the object that the event is being handled for.

Here's an example:

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    this.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
});
```

In this code, an event listener is added to a button that listens for the 'click' event. When the button is clicked, the `this` keyword inside the event handler refers to the button itself. So `this.style.backgroundColor = 'red';` changes the background color of the button to red.

It's important to note that the value of `this` can change depending on the context in which it's used. In the context of an event handler, it refers to the object that the event was dispatched on. But in other contexts, it might refer to something else. For example, in a method of an object, `this` refers to the object the method is a part of. In the global scope, `this` refers to the global object (which is the `window` object in a browser environment).

Also, be aware that if you use an arrow function as your event handler, `this` will not refer to the event target, but will instead be bound to the surrounding (lexical) context. If you need to access the event target in an arrow function, you can use `event.target` or `event.currentTarget`.



how to remove an event handler from element in js ?

In JavaScript, you can remove an event handler from an element using the `removeEventListener()` method. This method removes a previously registered event handler.

The `removeEventListener()` method requires the same parameters as when the handler was registered with `addEventListener()`. This includes the event type, the handler function, and the useCapture flag.

Here's an example:

```javascript
function handleClick(event) {
    // Your code here...
}

// Add event listener
element.addEventListener('click', handleClick, false);

// Remove event listener
element.removeEventListener('click', handleClick, false);
```

In this code, the `handleClick` function is first registered as an event handler for the 'click' event on the element. Then, it is removed using `removeEventListener()`.

It's important to note that in order to remove an event handler, you must pass the exact same function to `removeEventListener()` as was passed to `addEventListener()`. This means that if you used an anonymous function to handle the event, you won't be able to remove it because you don't have a reference to the function. So it's a good practice to always use named functions when you might need to remove the handler later. 

Also, the useCapture flag must be the same value when adding and removing the event listener. If it's not, the event listener won't be removed. If you didn't provide the useCapture flag when adding the event listener, you should not provide it when removing the event listener.



what are primitives and non-primitives ? and what are critical differences between two ?

In JavaScript, data types can be divided into two categories: **primitive** and **non-primitive** (or reference) types.

**Primitive types** are the basic, built-in types in JavaScript. They include:

1. **Number**: Represents numeric values, e.g., `123`, `120.50` etc.
2. **String**: Represents a sequence of characters, e.g., `"hello"`, `"world"` etc.
3. **Boolean**: Represents either `true` or `false`.
4. **Undefined**: Represents an undefined value. It is the default value of a variable that has not been assigned a specific value.
5. **Null**: Represents a null value, which means no value or no object. It implies an empty or non-existent value.
6. **Symbol**: Represents a unique identifier.
7. **BigInt**: Represents an integer with arbitrary precision.

**Non-primitive types** are objects and functions. They are called "reference types" because they are accessed by reference rather than by value.

The critical differences between primitive and non-primitive types are:

1. **Mutability**: Primitive values are **immutable**, which means that they cannot be changed. On the other hand, non-primitive values (objects and functions) are **mutable**. If you change a property of an object, the change will be seen by all references to the object.

2. **Comparison**: When comparing primitive values using `==` or `===`, JavaScript checks if the values are the same. But when comparing non-primitive values, JavaScript checks if the references point to the exact same object, not if the objects have the same properties or values.

3. **Memory Allocation**: Primitive values are stored directly on the stack, while non-primitive values are stored in the heap with a reference to the location in the heap stored on the stack.

4. **Property Addition**: You cannot add properties to primitive values. They are not objects so they cannot hold properties. Non-primitive values, on the other hand, can have properties added, changed, and removed because they are objects.

Here's a simple example to illustrate some of these differences:

```javascript
let primitive = 10;
let anotherPrimitive = primitive; // anotherPrimitive is now 10
primitive = 20; // Changing primitive doesn't affect anotherPrimitive

let obj = { value: 10 };
let anotherObj = obj; // anotherObj points to the same object as obj
obj.value = 20; // Changing obj also changes anotherObj
```

In this code, changing `primitive` doesn't affect `anotherPrimitive` because primitive values are passed by value. But changing `obj` also changes `anotherObj` because non-primitive values are passed by reference. This illustrates the difference in mutability and comparison between primitive and non-primitive types.


what is the type of coercien in js ?

In JavaScript, type coercion refers to the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another. It happens when you perform operations on values of different types, like combining a string and a number. JavaScript will implicitly convert one of the values to match the type of the other.

There are two types of coercion in JavaScript:

1. **Implicit Coercion**: JavaScript automatically converts one or both operands into a different type to complete the operation. For example:

```javascript
let result = '3' + 2; // result is '32'
```

In this case, JavaScript has implicitly coerced the number `2` into a string to perform string concatenation, resulting in the string `'32'`.

2. **Explicit Coercion**: The developer manually converts the values. For example:

```javascript
let num = '3';
let result = Number(num) + 2; // result is 5
```

In this case, the string `'3'` is explicitly coerced to a number using the `Number()` function, and then added to the number `2`, resulting in the number `5`.

It's important to understand how type coercion works in JavaScript, as it can lead to unexpected results if not handled properly. It's generally recommended to use explicit coercion (or avoid coercion altogether) to make the code behavior clearer.


what are operators ? what are types of operators  in js ?

In JavaScript, operators are special symbols that are used to perform operations on operands. An operand can be a value or a variable that the operation is performed on. 

Here are the types of operators in JavaScript:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: These are used to perform mathematical operations. Examples include `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), and `%` (modulus).

2. **Assignment Operators**: These are used to assign values to variables. Examples include `=` (assignment), `+=` (add and assign), `-=` (subtract and assign), and so on.

3. **Comparison Operators**: These are used to compare two values. Examples include `==` (equal to), `===` (equal value and equal type), `!=` (not equal), `!==` (not equal value or not equal type), `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less than or equal to), and `>=` (greater than or equal to).

4. **Logical Operators**: These are used to perform logical operations. Examples include `&&` (logical and), `||` (logical or), and `!` (logical not).

5. **Bitwise Operators**: These are used to perform bitwise operations. Examples include `&` (bitwise and), `|` (bitwise or), `^` (bitwise xor), `~` (bitwise not), `<<` (left shift), and `>>` (right shift).

6. **Unary Operators**: These are operators with only one operand. Examples include `++` (increment), `--` (decrement), and `typeof` (returns the type of a variable).

7. **Ternary Operator (Conditional)**: This is a shorthand for the `if` statement. It's represented as `? :`.

Here's an example of how some of these operators might be used:

```javascript
let x = 10; // assignment operator
let y = 5;

let z = x + y; // arithmetic operator
let isGreater = x > y; // comparison operator

x++; // unary operator

let result = isGreater ? 'x is greater' : 'y is greater'; // ternary operator
```

In this code, various operators are used to perform operations on the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`.



what is difference between unary and binary and ternary operators ?

In JavaScript, operators are classified based on the number of operands they work with. Here's how unary, binary, and ternary operators differ:

1. **Unary Operators**: Unary operators work with **one** operand. They perform an operation on a single value. Examples include the increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators, and logical negation (`!`) operator. For instance, if `x` is a variable, then `++x` or `!x` are unary operations.

```javascript
let x = 5;
x++; // unary operation, increments the value of x by 1
```

2. **Binary Operators**: Binary operators work with **two** operands. They perform an operation on two values. Examples include the addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`) operators. For instance, in the expression `5 + 3`, `+` is a binary operator that operates on the two numbers.

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 3;
let z = x + y; // binary operation, adds x and y
```

3. **Ternary Operator**: The ternary operator works with **three** operands. It's also known as the conditional operator and is the only ternary operator in JavaScript. It takes three operands and evaluates a condition: if the condition is true, it returns the first expression; otherwise, it returns the second expression. It's often used as a shortcut for the `if` statement.

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 3;
let result = (x > y) ? 'x is greater' : 'y is greater'; // ternary operation
```

In this code, `(x > y) ? 'x is greater' : 'y is greater'` is a ternary operation. If `x > y` is true, it returns `'x is greater'`; otherwise, it returns `'y is greater'`.

So, the main difference between unary, binary, and ternary operators is the number of operands they operate on: one for unary, two for binary, and three for ternary.


what is short-circuit evaluation in js ?


In JavaScript, short-circuit evaluation involves the use of logical operators `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) to potentially skip the evaluation of expressions.

Here's how it works:

1. **AND (`&&`) Operator**: If the first operand is falsy (i.e., evaluates to `false`), JavaScript will short-circuit and not even check the second operand. For example, in the expression `(false && anything)`, the `anything` part will never be evaluated because `false && anything` is always `false`.

```javascript
let result = false && console.log("Hello, world!");
// "Hello, world!" is not printed because the console.log statement is never executed.
```

2. **OR (`||`) Operator**: If the first operand is truthy (i.e., evaluates to `true`), JavaScript will short-circuit and not even check the second operand. For example, in the expression `(true || anything)`, the `anything` part will never be evaluated because `true || anything` is always `true`.

```javascript
let result = true || console.log("Hello, world!");
// "Hello, world!" is not printed because the console.log statement is never executed.
```

This behavior is useful in several scenarios, such as setting default values or avoiding null errors when accessing properties on undefined objects. However, it's important to understand this concept to avoid unexpected behavior in your code.


what i operator precedence ?

Operator precedence in JavaScript determines the order in which operations are performed when an expression has multiple operators. Operators with higher precedence are executed before operators with lower precedence.

Here's a simplified list of some operators in JavaScript, ordered from highest precedence to lowest:

1. **Grouping** `()`
2. **Increment/Decrement** `++`, `--`
3. **Unary plus/minus** `+`, `-`
4. **Multiplication/Division/Remainder** `*`, `/`, `%`
5. **Addition/Subtraction** `+`, `-`
6. **Relational** `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
7. **Equality** `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`
8. **Logical AND** `&&`
9. **Logical OR** `||`
10. **Conditional (ternary) operator** `? :`
11. **Assignment** `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.

For example, in the expression `1 + 2 * 3`, the multiplication is performed first because it has higher precedence, resulting in `1 + 6`, which then evaluates to `7`.

If operators have the same precedence, they are executed from left to right (except for the assignment and ternary operators, which are right-to-left). You can use parentheses to change the order of operations, as operations in parentheses are executed first.

It's important to understand operator precedence to correctly interpret and write JavaScript expressions. For a complete list of operator precedence and associativity in JavaScript, you can refer to the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence).


what are the types of conditions statements in js ?

In JavaScript, there are several types of conditional statements that allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. Here they are:

1. **If Statement**: The `if` statement is the most basic type of conditional statement. It executes a block of code if a specified condition is `true`.

```javascript
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
}
```

2. **Else Statement**: The `else` statement is used with an `if` statement to execute a block of code if the same condition is `false`.

```javascript
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if condition is false
}
```

3. **Else If Statement**: The `else if` statement is used to specify a new condition if the first condition is `false`.

```javascript
if (condition1) {
    // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if both condition1 and condition2 are false
}
```

4. **Switch Statement**: The `switch` statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. It's a good alternative to `if...else if...else` statements when you have many conditions.

```javascript
switch(expression) {
    case value1:
        // code to be executed if expression equals value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code to be executed if expression equals value2
        break;
    ...
    default:
        // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any cases
}
```

5. **Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator)**: The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing simple `if...else` statements. It takes three operands: a condition, a value if the condition is `true`, and a value if the condition is `false`.

```javascript
let result = condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;
```

These conditional statements are fundamental to programming in JavaScript, allowing for decision making in code based on specified conditions.


what is the diff between spread and rest operator in js ?

In JavaScript, both the spread (`...`) and rest (`...`) operators look similar but serve different purposes depending on the context in which they're used:

1. **Spread Operator (`...`)**: The spread operator is used to split up array elements OR object properties. 

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = [...arr, 4, 5]; // arr2 becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

let obj = {a: 1, b: 2};
let obj2 = {...obj, c: 3}; // obj2 becomes {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
```

In the above examples, the spread operator is used to expand the elements of `arr` and the properties of `obj`.

2. **Rest Operator (`...`)**: The rest operator is used to combine a list of function arguments into an array, or combine multiple array elements into one.

```javascript
function sum(...args) {
    return args.reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // logs 10

let [first, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(rest); // logs [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In the `sum` function, `...args` is an example of the rest operator. It's saying "group all remaining arguments into an array called `args`". In the array destructuring example, `...rest` is also an example of the rest operator. It's saying "put all elements, except for the first one, into an array called `rest`".

So, the key difference is that the spread operator "expands" an array into its elements or an object into its properties, while the rest operator does the opposite by combining multiple elements or variables into one array or object.



what is the difference  between  find() and filter()  methods of an array ? an what do they returns ?


The `find()` and `filter()` methods in JavaScript are both array methods that are used to extract elements from an array based on a certain condition. However, they have a key difference in their usage and what they return:

1. **Array.find()**: This method returns the **first element** in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no elements satisfy the testing function, it returns `undefined`.

```javascript
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let found = array.find(element => element > 2);
console.log(found); // logs 3
```

In this example, `find()` returns the first element in the array that is greater than 2.

2. **Array.filter()**: This method returns a **new array** containing all elements in the array that satisfy the provided testing function. If no elements satisfy the testing function, it returns an empty array.

```javascript
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let filtered = array.filter(element => element > 2);
console.log(filtered); // logs [3, 4, 5]
```

In this example, `filter()` returns a new array containing all elements in the array that are greater than 2.

So, the main difference is that `find()` returns the first matching element, while `filter()` returns all matching elements. Also, `filter()` returns a new array, while `find()` returns a single element (or `undefined`).



diff between push() and concat() ? diff between pop() and shift() ?

The `push()` and `concat()` methods, as well as the `pop()` and `shift()` methods, are used to manipulate arrays in JavaScript, but they work in different ways:

1. **push() vs concat()**:
    - **push()**: This method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array. It modifies the original array.
    ```javascript
    let arr = [1, 2, 3];
    arr.push(4); // arr is now [1, 2, 3, 4]
    ```
    - **concat()**: This method is used to merge two or more arrays and returns a new array. It does not change the existing arrays.
    ```javascript
    let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
    let arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
    let arr3 = arr1.concat(arr2); // arr3 is now [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    ```

2. **pop() vs shift()**:
    - **pop()**: This method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. It changes the length of the original array.
    ```javascript
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    let last = arr.pop(); // last is 4, arr is now [1, 2, 3]
    ```
    - **shift()**: This method removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the original array.
    ```javascript
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    let first = arr.shift(); // first is 1, arr is now [2, 3, 4]
    ```

So, the main differences are that `push()` modifies the original array while `concat()` does not, and `pop()` removes an element from the end of an array while `shift()` removes an element from the beginning.

slice() vs splice() ?

The `slice()` and `splice()` methods are both array methods in JavaScript, but they serve different purposes and have different effects on the original array:

1. **slice(startIndex, endIndex)**: This method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object. It does not modify the original array. The `startIndex` is inclusive and the `endIndex` is exclusive. If either parameter is negative, it is treated as `length+index` where `length` is the length of the array.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sliced = arr.slice(1, 3); // sliced is [2, 3], arr is still [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

2. **splice(startIndex, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...)**: This method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place. It returns an array containing the deleted elements (if any) and modifies the original array.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let spliced = arr.splice(1, 2, 'a', 'b'); // spliced is [2, 3], arr is now [1, 'a', 'b', 4, 5]
```

In this example, `splice()` starts at index 1, removes 2 elements and then adds 'a' and 'b' at that position.

So, the main difference is that `slice()` does not modify the original array and returns a new array, while `splice()` modifies the original array, can remove, replace, and add elements, and returns an array with the removed items.


map() and forEacj()  array method ??

The `map()` and `forEach()` methods in JavaScript are both array methods that execute a function on each item in an array. However, they serve different purposes:

1. **Array.map()**: This method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array. It does not change the original array.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let squares = arr.map(x => x * x); // squares is [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this example, `map()` takes a function that squares each element in the array and returns a new array with the squared values.

2. **Array.forEach()**: This method executes a provided function once for each array element. Unlike `map()`, `forEach()` does not return a new array, and it does not directly mutate the original array, but the callback function passed to `forEach()` can potentially mutate the original array.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.forEach((value, index, array) => {
    console.log(value); // logs each value in the array
});
```

In this example, `forEach()` takes a function that logs each element in the array. It does not return a new array.

So, the main difference is that `map()` returns a new array based on the result of the function, while `forEach()` simply executes the function on each element in the array without creating a new array.


how to sort and reverse ?

In JavaScript, you can use the `sort()` and `reverse()` methods to sort and reverse arrays:

1. **Array.sort()**: This method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. By default, it sorts elements as strings, which might give unexpected results for numeric arrays. You can pass a compare function to sort numbers or customize the sorting order.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 10, 2, 21];
arr.sort(); // arr is now [1, 10, 2, 21] because it sorts as strings

arr.sort((a, b) => a - b); // arr is now [1, 2, 10, 21] because we provided a compare function for numbers
```

2. **Array.reverse()**: This method reverses the order of the elements in an array in place and returns the reversed array.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.reverse(); // arr is now [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

Remember, both `sort()` and `reverse()` modify the original array. If you want to keep the original array unchanged, you can make a copy of the array before sorting or reversing it. You can do this using the `slice()` method or the spread operator (`...`):

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sorted = [...arr].sort();
let reversed = [...arr].reverse();
```

In this code, `sorted` and `reversed` are sorted and reversed copies of `arr`, but `arr` itself is not changed.


what is array destructuring javascript ? what are array-like object ?

In JavaScript, **array destructuring** is a syntax that allows you to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables. Here's an example:

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let [a, b, c] = arr; // a is 1, b is 2, c is 3
```

In this code, the array `arr` is destructured into the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variables take on the values of the corresponding elements in the array.

**Array-like objects** are objects that have a length property and use indices, but do not have built-in array methods like `push` or `forEach`. A common example of an array-like object is the `arguments` object in JavaScript functions, which contains a list of arguments passed to the function. Here's an example:

```javascript
function myFunc() {
    console.log(arguments[0]); // logs 'Hello'
    console.log(arguments.length); // logs 2
    console.log(arguments instanceof Array); // logs false
}

myFunc('Hello', 'World');
```

In this code, `arguments` is an array-like object. It has a length property and indices, but it does not have array methods, and it is not an instance of `Array`.

You can convert array-like objects to actual arrays using `Array.from()` or the spread operator (`...`):

```javascript
let arr = Array.from(arguments);
// or
let arr = [...arguments];
```

In these examples, `arr` is a true array created from the array-like `arguments` object. It has all the array methods available to it.

how to convert an array like object  into an object ?

In JavaScript, you can convert an array-like object into an actual object using various methods. One common way is to use the `Object.assign()` method along with the spread operator (`...`). Here's an example:

```javascript
let arrayLike = {0: 'Hello', 1: 'World', length: 2};
let obj = Object.assign({}, ...Array.from(arrayLike));
```

In this code, `Array.from(arrayLike)` converts the array-like object into an array. The spread operator (`...`) then spreads the elements of this array out into individual arguments to `Object.assign()`. `Object.assign()` takes these arguments and combines them into a single new object.

The resulting `obj` would be `{0: 'Hello', 1: 'World'}`.

Please note that the `length` property is not included in the new object because `Array.from()` only includes indexed elements. If you want to include the `length` property or any other non-indexed properties, you would need to handle them separately. Also, the keys in the resulting object are strings, because that's how JavaScript objects work - they can't have numbers as keys. If you want to convert these string keys to something else (like symbols or strings with a prefix), you would also need to handle that separately.


what are loops ? what arre the types of loops in js ?

In programming, a **loop** is a control structure that allows you to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met. Loops are used when you need to run the same code multiple times, each time with a different value.

In JavaScript, there are several types of loops:

1. **For Loop**: A `for` loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to `false`. It's commonly used when you know how many times you want to loop.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); // logs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
```

2. **While Loop**: A `while` loop executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`. It's often used when the number of iterations is unknown.

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i); // logs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    i++;
}
```

3. **Do...While Loop**: The `do...while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, except that the loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is `false`, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested.

```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i); // logs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

4. **For...In Loop**: The `for...in` loop is used to loop through the properties of an object.

```javascript
let obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
for (let prop in obj) {
    console.log(`${prop}: ${obj[prop]}`); // logs 'a: 1', 'b: 2', 'c: 3'
}
```

5. **For...Of Loop**: The `for...of` loop is used to loop over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, etc.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
for (let value of arr) {
    console.log(value); // logs 1, 2, 3
}
```

Each type of loop is useful in different scenarios, depending on what you need to do and the nature of the data you're working with.



diff betweeen  while and for loops ?


In JavaScript, both `while` and `for` loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code, but they differ in their syntax and when you would use each one:

1. **For Loop**: A `for` loop is generally used when you know how many times you want to loop. It has three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); // logs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
```

In this example, `i = 0` is the initialization, `i < 5` is the condition that is checked before each loop iteration, and `i++` is the increment that happens after each iteration.

2. **While Loop**: A `while` loop is generally used when you don't know how many times you want to loop, and you want to keep looping as long as a certain condition is true.

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i); // logs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    i++;
}
```

In this example, `i < 5` is the condition that is checked before each loop iteration, and `i++` is the increment that happens in the loop body.

So, the main difference is in their syntax and when you would use each one: use a `for` loop when you know how many times you want to loop, and a `while` loop when you want to keep looping as long as a condition is true.


diff between for and for-of loop  in js ?

In JavaScript, both `for` and `for...of` loops are used to iterate over elements in a collection, but they differ in their syntax and usage:

1. **For Loop**: A `for` loop is a control structure that lets you iterate over elements in a collection using an index. You have to manually define the start condition, the end condition, and the update expression.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]); // logs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
}
```

In this example, `i = 0` is the start condition, `i < arr.length` is the end condition, and `i++` is the update expression. You have access to the index `i` in each iteration.

2. **For...Of Loop**: The `for...of` loop is a newer addition to JavaScript that provides a simpler, more readable syntax to iterate over iterable objects (like arrays, strings, maps, etc.). It abstracts away the need to manage an index variable.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let value of arr) {
    console.log(value); // logs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
}
```

In this example, `value` is a variable that will hold the current value in each iteration of the loop. You don't have direct access to the index of the element, but the code is more readable and concise.

So, the main difference is that a `for` loop gives you more control and is more flexible (you can iterate over elements in a custom order, you can skip elements, etc.), but it's more verbose. A `for...of` loop is simpler and more readable, but it's less flexible (it always iterates over all elements in their natural order) and doesn't give you direct access to the index of the element.


diff between for-in and for-of loop  in js ?

In JavaScript, both `for...in` and `for...of` loops are used to iterate over collections, but they serve different purposes:

1. **For...In Loop**: The `for...in` loop is used to iterate over the **enumerable properties** of an object, in an arbitrary order. For arrays, this includes the array indices (which are actually properties under the hood), but also any additional properties that you may have added. It's generally better to use `for...in` with objects, not arrays.

```javascript
let obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
for (let key in obj) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${obj[key]}`); // logs 'a: 1', 'b: 2', 'c: 3'
}
```

2. **For...Of Loop**: The `for...of` loop is used to iterate over **iterable objects** like arrays, strings, maps, etc. It gives you a clean, simple way to iterate over the values of an iterable object.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
for (let value of arr) {
    console.log(value); // logs 1, 2, 3
}
```

So, the main difference is that `for...in` is used to iterate over the properties of an object, while `for...of` is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object. It's important to choose the right loop based on what you need to do.


what is diff between named and annonymous functions  in js ?

In JavaScript, functions can be defined in a few different ways, and this leads to the distinction between named and anonymous functions:

1. **Named Functions**: A named function is a function definition that includes a name. The name can be used to call the function later in your code, and it also appears in the stack trace when the function is involved in an error. Here's an example:

```javascript
function greet() {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
}

greet(); // logs 'Hello, world!'
```

In this example, `greet` is a named function.

2. **Anonymous Functions**: An anonymous function is a function definition that does not include a name. Anonymous functions are often used as arguments to other functions or as immediately invoked function expressions (IIFEs). Here's an example:

```javascript
setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
}, 1000);
```

In this example, the function passed to `setTimeout` is an anonymous function.

The main difference between named and anonymous functions is that named functions have a name, while anonymous functions do not. This name can be useful for debugging and for self-documenting your code. However, anonymous functions can be useful when you need a quick, throwaway function that won't be reused elsewhere in your code. It's important to choose the right type of function based on your needs.


when to use what ?

The decision to use named or anonymous functions, `for` or `while` loops, `map()` or `forEach()`, and so on, depends on the specific requirements of your code. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Named vs Anonymous Functions**: Use named functions when you want to declare a function that can be called later in your code. Use anonymous functions for throwaway functions that won't be reused, such as callbacks or event handlers.

2. **For vs While Loops**: Use `for` loops when you know how many times you want to loop. Use `while` loops when you want to keep looping as long as a condition is true.

3. **Map vs ForEach**: Use `map()` when you want to create a new array by transforming every element in an existing array. Use `forEach()` when you want to execute a function on each element in an array but don't need to create a new array.

4. **For vs For...Of Loops**: Use `for` loops when you need more control over the iteration (like custom start/end conditions or incrementing by more than one). Use `for...of` loops when you simply want to iterate over all elements in an iterable object in their natural order.

5. **Push vs Concat**: Use `push()` when you want to add one or more elements to the end of an array and modify the original array. Use `concat()` when you want to merge two or more arrays into a new array without modifying the original arrays.

6. **Pop vs Shift**: Use `pop()` to remove the last element from an array. Use `shift()` to remove the first element from an array.

Remember, these are just guidelines and the best choice depends on the specific needs of your code. It's always a good idea to understand how these constructs work so you can make the best decision.
