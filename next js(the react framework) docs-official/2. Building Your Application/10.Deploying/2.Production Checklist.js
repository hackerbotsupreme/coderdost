// Production Checklist
// Before taking your Next.js application to production, there are some optimizations
//  and patterns you should consider implementing for the best user experience, 
// performance, and security.

// This page provides best practices that you can use as a reference when building 
// your application, before going to production, and after deployment - as well as 
// the automatic Next.js optimizations you should be aware of.

// Automatic optimizations
// These Next.js optimizations are enabled by default and require no configuration:

// Server Components: Next.js uses Server Components by default. Server Components 
// run on the server, and don't require JavaScript to render on the client. As such,
//  they have no impact on the size of your client-side JavaScript bundles. You can 
// then use Client Components as needed for interactivity.

// Code-splitting: Server Components enable automatic code-splitting by route 
// segments. You may also consider lazy loading Client Components and third-party 
// libraries, where appropriate.

// Prefetching: When a link to a new route enters the user's viewport, Next.js
//  prefetches the route in background. This makes navigation to new routes almost
//  instant. You can opt out of prefetching, where appropriate.

// Static Rendering: Next.js statically renders Server and Client Components on the 
// server at build time and caches the rendered result to improve your application's
//  performance. You can opt into Dynamic Rendering for specific routes, where appropriate.
// Caching: Next.js caches data requests, the rendered result of Server and Client 
// Components, static assets, and more, to reduce the number of network requests to 
// your server, database, and backend services. You may opt out of caching, where appropriate.
// These defaults aim to improve your application's performance, and reduce the 
// cost and amount of data transferred on each network request.

// During development
// While building your application, we recommend using the following features 
// to ensure the best performance and user experience:

// Routing and rendering
// Layouts: Use layouts to share UI across pages and enable partial rendering on navigation.
// <Link> component: Use the <Link> component for client-side navigation and prefetching.
// Error Handling: Gracefully handle catch-all errors and 404 errors in production 
// by creating custom error pages.
// Composition Patterns: Follow the recommended composition patterns for Server and
//  Client Components, and check the placement of your "use client" boundaries to 
// avoid unnecessarily increasing your client-side JavaScript bundle.
// Dynamic Functions: Be aware that dynamic functions like cookies() and 
// the searchParams prop will opt the entire route into Dynamic Rendering 
// (or your whole application if used in the Root Layout). Ensure dynamic 
// function usage is intentional and wrap them in <Suspense> boundaries where appropriate.

// Good to know: Partial Prerendering (Experimental) will allow parts of a route 
// to be dynamic without opting the whole route into dynamic rendering.

// Data fetching and caching
// Server Components: Leverage the benefits of fetching data on the server using Server Components.
// Route Handlers: Use Route Handlers to access your backend resources from Client
//  Components. But do not call Route Handlers from Server Components to avoid 
// an additional server request.
// Streaming: Use Loading UI and React Suspense to progressively send UI from 
// the server to the client, and prevent the whole route from blocking while data
//  is being fetched.
// Parallel Data Fetching: Reduce network waterfalls by fetching data in parallel,
//  where appropriate. Also, consider preloading data where appropriate.
// Data Caching: Verify whether your data requests are being cached or not, and 
// opt into caching, where appropriate. Ensure requests that don't use fetch are cached.
// Static Images: Use the public directory to automatically cache your application's 
// static assets, e.g. images.


// UI and accessibility
// Forms and Validation: Use Server Actions to handle form submissions, server-side 
// validation, and handle errors.
// Font Module: Optimize fonts by using the Font Module, which automatically hosts 
// your font files with other static assets, removes external network requests, and 
// reduces layout shift.
// <Image> Component: Optimize images by using the Image Component, which 
// automatically optimizes images, prevents layout shift, and serves them in
//  modern formats like WebP or AVIF.
// <Script> Component: Optimize third-party scripts by using the Script Component, 
// which automatically defers scripts and prevents them from blocking the main thread.
// ESLint: Use the built-in eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y plugin to catch accessibility issues early.


// Security
// Tainting: Prevent sensitive data from being exposed to the client by tainting 
// data objects and/or specific values.
// Server Actions: Ensure users are authorized to call Server Actions. Review the 
// the recommended security practices.
// Environment Variables: Ensure your .env.* files are added to .gitignore and 
// only public variables are prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_.
// Content Security Policy: Consider adding a Content Security Policy to protect 
// your application against various security threats such as cross-site scripting, 
// clickjacking, and other code injection attacks.

// Metadata and SEO
// Metadata API: Use the Metadata API to improve your application's Search Engine 
// Optimization (SEO) by adding page titles, descriptions, and more.
// Open Graph (OG) images: Create OG images to prepare your application for social sharing.
// Sitemaps and Robots: Help Search Engines crawl and index your pages by 
// generating sitemaps and robots files.

// Type safety
// TypeScript and TS Plugin: Use TypeScript and the TypeScript plugin for 
// better type-safety, and to help you catch errors early.

// Before going to production
// Before going to production, you can run next build to build your application 
// locally and catch any build errors, then run next start to measure the performance
//  of your application in a production-like environment.

// Core Web Vitals
// Lighthouse: Run lighthouse in incognito to gain a better understanding of how 
// your users will experience your site, and to identify areas for improvement. 
// This is a simulated test and should be paired with looking at field data 
// (such as Core Web Vitals).
// useReportWebVitals hook: Use this hook to send Core Web Vitals data to analytics tools.
// Analyzing bundles
// Use the @next/bundle-analyzer plugin to analyze the size of your JavaScript 
// bundles and identify large modules and dependencies that might be impacting 
// your application's performance.

// Additionally, the following tools can you understand the impact of adding new dependencies to your application:

// Import Cost
// Package Phobia
// Bundle Phobia
// bundlejs

// After deployment
// Depending on where you deploy your application, you might have access to 
// additional tools and integrations to help you monitor and improve your 
// application's performance.

// For Vercel deployments, we recommend the following:

// Analytics: A built-in analytics dashboard to help you understand your 
// application's traffic, including the number of unique visitors, page views, and more.
// Speed Insights: Real-world performance insights based on visitor data, offering 
// a practical view of how your website is performing in the field.
// Logging: Runtime and Activity logs to help you debug issues and monitor your 
// application in production. Alternatively, see the integrations page for a list 
// of third-party tools and services.

// Good to know:

// To get a comprehensive understanding of the best practices for production 
// deployments on Vercel, including detailed strategies for improving website 
// performance, refer to the Vercel Production Checklist.

// Following these recommendations will help you build a faster, more reliable, 
// and secure application for your users.
