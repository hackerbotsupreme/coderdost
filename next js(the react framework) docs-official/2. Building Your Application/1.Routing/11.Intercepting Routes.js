// Intercepting Routes
// Intercepting routes allows you to load a route from another part of your 
// application within the current layout. This routing paradigm can be useful when 
// you want to display the content of a route without the user switching to a 
// different context.

// For example, when clicking on a photo in a feed, you can display the photo in 
// a modal, overlaying the feed. In this case, Next.js intercepts the /photo/123 
// route, masks the URL, and overlays it over /feed.

// Intercepting routes soft navigation
// However, when navigating to the photo by clicking a shareable URL or by 
// refreshing the page, the entire photo page should render instead of the modal.
//  No route interception should occur.

// Intercepting routes hard navigation
// Convention
// Intercepting routes can be defined with the (..) convention, which is similar 
// to relative path convention ../ but for segments.

// You can use:

// (.) to match segments on the same level
// (..) to match segments one level above
// (..)(..) to match segments two levels above
// (...) to match segments from the root app directory
// For example, you can intercept the photo segment from within the feed segment 
// by creating a (..)photo directory.

// Intercepting routes folder structure
// Note that the (..) convention is based on route segments, not the file-system.

// Examples
// Modals
// Intercepting Routes can be used together with Parallel Routes to create modals.
//  This allows you to solve common challenges when building modals, such as:

// Making the modal content shareable through a URL.
// Preserving context when the page is refreshed, instead of closing the modal.
// Closing the modal on backwards navigation rather than going to the previous route.
// Reopening the modal on forwards navigation.
// Consider the following UI pattern, where a user can open a photo modal from 
// a gallery using client-side navigation, or navigate to the photo page directly 
// from a shareable URL:

// Intercepting routes modal example
// In the above example, the path to the photo segment can use the (..) matcher
//  since @modal is a slot and not a segment. This means that the photo route is 
// only one segment level higher, despite being two file-system levels higher.

// See the Parallel Routes documentation for a step-by-step example, or see our image gallery example.

// Good to know:

// Other examples could include opening a login modal in a top navbar while also having a dedicated /login page, or opening a shopping cart in a side modal.

// Parallel Routes
// Simultaneously render one or more pages in the same view that can be navigated independently. A pattern for highly dynamic applications.
