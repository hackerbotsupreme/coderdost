// Caching in Next.js
// Next.js improves your application's performance and reduces costs by caching 
// rendering work and data requests. This page provides an in-depth look at Next.js 
// caching mechanisms, the APIs you can use to configure them, and how they interact 
// with each other.

// Good to know: This page helps you understand how Next.js works under the hood but 
// is not essential knowledge to be productive with Next.js. Most of Next.js' caching 
// heuristics are determined by your API usage and have defaults for the best 
// performance with zero or minimal configuration.
