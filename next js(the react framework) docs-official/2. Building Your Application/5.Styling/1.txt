Next.js supports different ways of styling your application, including:

Global CSS: Simple to use and familiar for those experienced with traditional CSS, but can lead to larger CSS bundles and difficulty managing styles as the application grows.
CSS Modules: Create locally scoped CSS classes to avoid naming conflicts and improve maintainability.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid custom designs by composing utility classes.
Sass: A popular CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.
CSS-in-JS: Embed CSS directly in your JavaScript components, enabling dynamic and scoped styling.
