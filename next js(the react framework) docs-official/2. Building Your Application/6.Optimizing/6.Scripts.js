// Script Optimization
// Layout Scripts
// To load a third-party script for multiple routes, import next/script and 
// include the script directly in your layout component:

// app/dashboard/layout.tsx
import Script from 'next/script'
 
export default function DashboardLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <>
      <section>{children}</section>
      <Script src="https://example.com/script.js" />
    </>
  )
}
// The third-party script is fetched when the folder route (e.g. dashboard/page.js) 
// or any nested route (e.g. dashboard/settings/page.js) is accessed by the user.
//  Next.js will ensure the script will only load once, even if a user navigates
//  between multiple routes in the same layout.

// Application Scripts
// To load a third-party script for all routes, import next/script and include
//  the script directly in your root layout:

// app/layout.tsx
import Script from 'next/script'
 
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
      <Script src="https://example.com/script.js" />
    </html>
  )
}
// This script will load and execute when any route in your application is accessed. 
// Next.js will ensure the script will only load once, even if a user navigates between 
// multiple pages.

// Recommendation: We recommend only including third-party scripts in specific pages 
// or layouts in order to minimize any unnecessary impact to performance.

// Strategy
// Although the default behavior of next/script allows you to load third-party scripts 
// in any page or layout, you can fine-tune its loading behavior by using the strategy 
// property:

// beforeInteractive: Load the script before any Next.js code and before any page hydration occurs.
// afterInteractive: (default) Load the script early but after some hydration on 
// the page occurs.
// lazyOnload: Load the script later during browser idle time.
// worker: (experimental) Load the script in a web worker.
// Refer to the next/script API reference documentation to learn more about each 
// strategy and their use cases.

// Offloading Scripts To A Web Worker (Experimental)
// Warning: The worker strategy is not yet stable and does not yet work with 
// the app directory. Use with caution.

// Scripts that use the worker strategy are offloaded and executed in a web worker
//  with Partytown. This can improve the performance of your site by dedicating 
// the main thread to the rest of your application code.

// This strategy is still experimental and can only be used if the nextScriptWorkers 
// flag is enabled in next.config.js:

// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    nextScriptWorkers: true,
  },
}
// Then, run next (normally npm run dev or yarn dev) and Next.js will guide you 
// through the installation of the required packages to finish the setup:

// Terminal
npm run dev
// You'll see instructions like these: Please install Partytown by running 
// npm install @builder.io/partytown

// Once setup is complete, defining strategy="worker" will automatically instantiate
//  Partytown in your application and offload the script to a web worker.

// pages/home.tsx
import Script from 'next/script'
 
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Script src="https://example.com/script.js" strategy="worker" />
    </>
  )
}
// There are a number of trade-offs that need to be considered when loading 
// a third-party script in a web worker. Please see Partytown's tradeoffs 
// documentation for more information.

// Inline Scripts
// Inline scripts, or scripts not loaded from an external file, are also supported by 
// the Script component. They can be written by placing the JavaScript within curly 
// braces:

<Script id="show-banner">
  {`document.getElementById('banner').classList.remove('hidden')`}
</Script>
// Or by using the dangerouslySetInnerHTML property:
      // <Script
      //   id="show-banner"
      //   dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
      //     __html: `document.getElementById('banner').classList.remove('hidden')`,
      //   }}
      // />

// Warning: An id property must be assigned for inline scripts in order for Next.js 
// to track and optimize the script.

// Executing Additional Code
// Event handlers can be used with the Script component to execute additional code 
// after a certain event occurs:
// onLoad: Execute code after the script has finished loading.
// onReady: Execute code after the script has finished loading and every time the component is mounted.
// onError: Execute code if the script fails to load.
// These handlers will only work when next/script is imported and used inside of 
// a Client Component where "use client" is defined as the first line of code:

// app/page.tsx
'use client'
 
import Script from 'next/script'
 
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <Script
        src="https://example.com/script.js"
        onLoad={() => {
          console.log('Script has loaded')
        }}
      />
    </>
  )
}
// Refer to the next/script API reference to learn more about each event handler 
// and view examples.

// Additional Attributes
// There are many DOM attributes that can be assigned to a <script> element that 
// are not used by the Script component, like nonce or custom data attributes. 
// Including any additional attributes will automatically forward it to the final,
//  optimized <script> element that is included in the HTML.

// app/page.tsx
import Script from 'next/script'
 
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <Script
        src="https://example.com/script.js"
        id="example-script"
        nonce="XUENAJFW"
        data-test="script"
      />
    </>
  )
}
