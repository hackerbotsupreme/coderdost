// Instrumentation
// Instrumentation is the process of using code to integrate monitoring and logging 
// tools into your application. This allows you to track the performance and behavior 
// of your application, and to debug issues in production.

// Convention
// To set up instrumentation, create instrumentation.ts|js file in the root directory 
// of your project (or inside the src folder if using one).

// Then, export a register function in the file. This function will be called once when 
// a new Next.js server instance is initiated.

// For example, to use Next.js with OpenTelemetry and @vercel/otel:

// instrumentation.ts
import { registerOTel } from '@vercel/otel'
export function register() {
  registerOTel('next-app')
}
// See the Next.js with OpenTelemetry example for a complete implementation.

// Good to know
// This feature is experimental. To use it, you must explicitly opt in by defining
//  experimental.instrumentationHook = true; in your next.config.js.
// The instrumentation file should be in the root of your project and not inside 
// the app or pages directory. If you're using the src folder, then place the file 
// inside src alongside pages and app.
// If you use the pageExtensions config option to add a suffix, you will also need 
// to update the instrumentation filename to match.


// Examples
// Importing files with side effects
// Sometimes, it may be useful to import a file in your code because of the side effects 
// it will cause. For example, you might import a file that defines a set of global 
// variables, but never explicitly use the imported file in your code. You would 
// still have access to the global variables the package has declared.

// We recommend importing files using JavaScript import syntax within your register 
// function. The following example demonstrates a basic usage of import in a register 
// function:

// instrumentation.ts
export async function register() {
  await import('package-with-side-effect')
}
// Good to know:
// We recommend importing the file from within the register function, rather than at 
// the top of the file. By doing this, you can colocate all of your side effects in one
//  place in your code, and avoid any unintended consequences from importing globally at 
// the top of the file.

// Importing runtime-specific code
// Next.js calls register in all environments, so it's important to conditionally import
//  any code that doesn't support specific runtimes (e.g. Edge or Node.js). You can use 
// the NEXT_RUNTIME environment variable to get the current environment:

// instrumentation.ts
export async function register() {
  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs') {
    await import('./instrumentation-node')
  }
  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'edge') {
    await import('./instrumentation-edge')
  }
}
