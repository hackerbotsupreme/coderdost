// Image Optimization
// Image Component
// According to Web Almanac, images account for a huge portion of the typical
//  websiteâ€™s page weight and can have a sizable impact on your website's 
// LCP performance.

// The Next.js Image component extends the HTML <img> element with features for 
// automatic image optimization:

// Size Optimization: Automatically serve correctly sized images for each device, u
// sing modern image formats like WebP and AVIF.
// Visual Stability: Prevent layout shift automatically when images are loading.
// Faster Page Loads: Images are only loaded when they enter the viewport using 
// native browser lazy loading, with optional blur-up placeholders.

// Asset Flexibility: On-demand image resizing, even for images stored on remote servers
// ðŸŽ¥ Watch: Learn more about how to use next/image â†’ YouTube (9 minutes).

// Usage

// import Image from 'next/image'
// You can then define the src for your image (either local or remote).

// Local Images
// To use a local image, import your .jpg, .png, or .webp image files.

// Next.js will automatically determine the width and height of your image based on 
// the imported file. These values are used to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift while 
// your image is loading.

// app/page.js
import Image from 'next/image'
import profilePic from './me.png'
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Image
      src={profilePic}
      alt="Picture of the author"
      // width={500} automatically provided
      // height={500} automatically provided
      // blurDataURL="data:..." automatically provided
      // placeholder="blur" // Optional blur-up while loading
    />
  )
}
// Warning: Dynamic await import() or require() are not supported. The import must 
// be static so it can be analyzed at build time.

// Remote Images
// To use a remote image, the src property should be a URL string.

// Since Next.js does not have access to remote files during the build process, 
// you'll need to provide the width, height and optional blurDataURL props manually.

// The width and height attributes are used to infer the correct aspect ratio of image 
// and avoid layout shift from the image loading in. The width and height do not
//  determine the rendered size of the image file. Learn more about Image Sizing.

// app/page.js

import Image from 'next/image'
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/profile.png"
      alt="Picture of the author"
      width={500}
      height={500}
    />
  )
}
// To safely allow optimizing images, define a list of supported URL patterns in
//  next.config.js. Be as specific as possible to prevent malicious usage. For 
// example, the following configuration will only allow images from a specific 
// AWS S3 bucket:

// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 's3.amazonaws.com',
        port: '',
        pathname: '/my-bucket/**',
      },
    ],
  },
}
// Learn more about remotePatterns configuration. If you want to use relative URLs 
// for the image src, use a loader.

// Domains
// Sometimes you may want to optimize a remote image, but still use the built-in 
// Next.js Image Optimization API. To do this, leave the loader at its default 
// setting and enter an absolute URL for the Image src prop.

// To protect your application from malicious users, you must define a list of 
// remote hostnames you intend to use with the next/image component.

// Learn more about remotePatterns configuration.

// Loaders
// Note that in the example earlier, a partial URL ("/me.png") is provided for a local
//  image. This is possible because of the loader architecture.

// A loader is a function that generates the URLs for your image. It modifies 
// the provided src, and generates multiple URLs to request the image at different 
// sizes. These multiple URLs are used in the automatic srcset generation, so that 
// visitors to your site will be served an image that is the right size for 
// their viewport.

// The default loader for Next.js applications uses the built-in Image Optimization API,
//  which optimizes images from anywhere on the web, and then serves them directly from 
// the Next.js web server. If you would like to serve your images directly from a CDN or
//  image server, you can write your own loader function with a few lines of JavaScript.

// You can define a loader per-image with the loader prop, or at the application level
//  with the loaderFile configuration.

// Priority
// You should add the priority property to the image that will be the Largest Contentful 
// Paint (LCP) element for each page. Doing so allows Next.js to specially prioritize 
// the image for loading (e.g. through preload tags or priority hints), leading to 
// a meaningful boost in LCP.

// The LCP element is typically the largest image or text block visible within 
// the viewport of the page. When you run next dev, you'll see a console warning 
// if the LCP element is an <Image> without the priority property.

// Once you've identified the LCP image, you can add the property like this:

// app/page.js
import Image from 'next/image'
import profilePic from '../public/me.png'
export default function Page() {
  return <Image src={profilePic} alt="Picture of the author" priority />
}
// See more about priority in the next/image component documentation.

// Image Sizing
// One of the ways that images most commonly hurt performance is through layout shift, 
// where the image pushes other elements around on the page as it loads in. 
// This performance problem is so annoying to users that it has its own Core Web Vital, 
// called Cumulative Layout Shift. The way to avoid image-based layout shifts is to
//  always size your images. This allows the browser to reserve precisely enough space 
// for the image before it loads.

// Because next/image is designed to guarantee good performance results, it cannot be
//  used in a way that will contribute to layout shift, and must be sized in one of 
// three ways:

// Automatically, using a static import
// Explicitly, by including a width and height property
// Implicitly, by using fill which causes the image to expand to fill its parent element.
// What if I don't know the size of my images?

// If you are accessing images from a source without knowledge of the images' sizes, 
// there are several things you can do:

// Use fill

// The fill prop allows your image to be sized by its parent element. Consider using 
// CSS to give the image's parent element space on the page along sizes prop to match any media query break points. You can also use object-fit with fill, contain, or cover, 
// and object-position to define how the image should occupy that space.

// Normalize your images

// If you're serving images from a source that you control, consider modifying your 
// image pipeline to normalize the images to a specific size.

// Modify your API calls

// If your application is retrieving image URLs using an API call (such as to a CMS), 
// you may be able to modify the API call to return the image dimensions along with 
// the URL.

// If none of the suggested methods works for sizing your images, the next/image 
// component is designed to work well on a page alongside standard <img> elements.

// Styling
// Styling the Image component is similar to styling a normal <img> element, but 
// there are a few guidelines to keep in mind:

// Use className or style, not styled-jsx.
// In most cases, we recommend using the className prop. This can be an imported
//  CSS Module, a global stylesheet, etc.
// You can also use the style prop to assign inline styles.
// You cannot use styled-jsx because it's scoped to the current component 
// (unless you mark the style as global).
// When using fill, the parent element must have position: relative
// This is necessary for the proper rendering of the image element in that layout mode.
// When using fill, the parent element must have display: block
// This is the default for <div> elements but should be specified otherwise.


// Examples
// Responsive
// Responsive image filling the width and height of its parent container

import Image from 'next/image'
import mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg' 
export default function Responsive() {
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>
      <Image
        alt="Mountains"
        // Importing an image will
        // automatically set the width and height
        src={mountains}
        sizes="100vw"
        // Make the image display full width
        style={{
          width: '100%',
          height: 'auto',
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
// Fill Container
// Grid of images filling parent container width

import Image from 'next/image'
import mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'
export default function Fill() {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'grid',
        gridGap: '8px',
        gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(auto-fit, minmax(400px, auto))',
      }}
    >
      <div style={{ position: 'relative', height: '400px' }}>
        <Image
          alt="Mountains"
          src={mountains}
          fill
          sizes="(min-width: 808px) 50vw, 100vw"
          style={{
            objectFit: 'cover', // cover, contain, none
          }}
        />
      </div>
      {/* And more images in the grid... */}
    </div>

import Image from 'next/image'
import mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'
export default function Background() {
  return (
    <Image
      alt="Mountains"
      src={mountains}
      placeholder="blur"
      quality={100}
