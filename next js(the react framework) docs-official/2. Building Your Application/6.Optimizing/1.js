// Optimizations
// Next.js comes with a variety of built-in optimizations designed to improve your application's speed and Core Web Vitals(https://web.dev/vitals/). This guide will cover the optimizations you can leverage to enhance your user experience.

// Built-in Components
// Built-in components abstract away the complexity of implementing common UI optimizations. These components are:

// Images: Built on the native <img> element. The Image Component optimizes images for performance by lazy loading and automatically resizing images based on device size.
// Link: Built on the native <a> tags. The Link Component prefetches pages in the background, for faster and smoother page transitions.
// Scripts: Built on the native <script> tags. The Script Component gives you control over loading and execution of third-party scripts.
// Metadata
// Metadata helps search engines understand your content better (which can result in better SEO), and allows you to customize how your content is presented on social media, helping you create a more engaging and consistent user experience across various platforms.

// The Metadata API in Next.js allows you to modify the <head> element of a page. You can configure metadata in two ways:

// Config-based Metadata: Export a static metadata object or a dynamic generateMetadata function in a layout.js or page.js file.
// File-based Metadata: Add static or dynamically generated special files to route segments.
// Additionally, you can create dynamic Open Graph Images using JSX and CSS with imageResponse constructor.

// Static Assets
// Next.js /public folder can be used to serve static assets like images, fonts, and other files. Files inside /public can also be cached by CDN providers so that they are delivered efficiently.

// Analytics and Monitoring
// For large applications, Next.js integrates with popular analytics and monitoring tools to help you understand how your application is performing. Learn more in the OpenTelemetry and Instrumentation guides.

// Images
// Optimize your images with the built-in `next/image` component.
// Videos
// Recommendations and best practices for optimizing videos in your Next.js application.
// Fonts
// Optimize your application's web fonts with the built-in `next/font` loaders.
// Metadata
// Use the Metadata API to define metadata in any layout or page.
// Scripts
// Optimize 3rd party scripts with the built-in Script component.
// Bundle Analyzer
// Analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles using the @next/bundle-analyzer plugin.
// Lazy Loading
// Lazy load imported libraries and React Components to improve your application's loading performance.
// Analytics
// Measure and track page performance using Next.js Speed Insights
// Instrumentation
// Learn how to use instrumentation to run code at server startup in your Next.js app
// OpenTelemetry
// Learn how to instrument your Next.js app with OpenTelemetry.
// Static Assets
// Next.js allows you to serve static files, like images, in the public directory. You can learn how it works here.
// Third Party Libraries
// Optimize the performance of third-party libraries in your application with the `@next/third-parties` package.
