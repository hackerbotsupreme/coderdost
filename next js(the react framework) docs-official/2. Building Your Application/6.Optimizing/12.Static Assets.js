// Static Assets
// Static Assets in `public`
// Next.js can serve static files, like images, under a folder called public in 
// the root directory. Files inside public can then be referenced by your code 
// starting from the base URL (/).

// For example, the file public/avatars/me.png can be viewed by visiting 
// the /avatars/me.png path. The code to display that image might look like:

// avatar.js
import Image from 'next/image'
export function Avatar({ id, alt }) {
  return <Image src={`/avatars/${id}.png`} alt={alt} width="64" height="64" />
}
export function AvatarOfMe() {
  return <Avatar id="me" alt="A portrait of me" />
}
// Caching
// Next.js cannot safely cache assets in the public folder because they may change. 
// The default caching headers applied are:
Cache-Control: public, max-age=0

// Robots, Favicons, and others
// For static metadata files, such as robots.txt, favicon.ico, etc, you should 
// use special metadata files inside the app folder.

// Good to know:
// The directory must be named public. The name cannot be changed and it's the only directory used to serve static assets.
// Only assets that are in the public directory at build time will be served by Next.js.
//  Files added at request time won't be available. We recommend using a third-party 
// service like Vercel Blob for persistent file storage.
