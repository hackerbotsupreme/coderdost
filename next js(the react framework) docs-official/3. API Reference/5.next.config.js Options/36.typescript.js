// typescript
// Next.js fails your production build (next build) when TypeScript errors 
// are present in your project.

// If you'd like Next.js to dangerously produce production code even when 
// your application has errors, you can disable the built-in type checking step.

// If disabled, be sure you are running type checks as part of your build or 
// deploy process, otherwise this can be very dangerous.

// Open next.config.js and enable the ignoreBuildErrors option in the typescript config:

// next.config.js

module.exports = {
  typescript: {
    // !! WARN !!
    // Dangerously allow production builds to successfully complete even if
    // your project has type errors.
    // !! WARN !!
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  },
}
